+ The rapid expansion of digital services and applications has significantly increased the complexity and demands on modern network infrastructures. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a pivotal technology in addressing these challenges by offering enhanced control and flexibility in network management. Unlike traditional networking approaches, SDN separates the network control plane from the data plane, allowing centralized control over traffic routing and network policies. This separation facilitates dynamic and efficient management of network resources, which is essential for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) in diverse and fluctuating network conditions.
+ QoS management is critical for ensuring that network performance meets the requirements of various applications, particularly those with stringent performance criteria such as real-time communications, streaming services, and mission-critical applications. Effective QoS management involves classifying network traffic to prioritize critical data flows, allocate bandwidth, and minimize latency and packet loss. However, traditional QoS mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with the dynamic nature of network traffic and the evolving needs of applications.
+ Machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution for enhancing traffic classification and QoS management in SDN environments. By leveraging data-driven models, ML algorithms can analyze traffic patterns and adaptively classify and prioritize traffic based on its characteristics and QoS requirements. This approach enables more granular and efficient traffic management compared to static, rule-based methods.
